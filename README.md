# Scraping-Car-Details
## Web Scraping Car Details from Cars24.com
## Project Objective:  
The objective of this project is to develop skills in web scraping by extracting and analyzing car details from Cars24.com. All 20 team members gathered data specific to the Mumbai location, covering key 
information such as kilometers driven, year of manufacture, fuel type, transmission, and price.
## Project Requirements:
1) Scraping Target: Cars listed on Cars24.com for the Mumbai location.

2) Data to Collect: Kilometers Driven, Year of Manufacture, Fuel Type, Transmission, Price
 ## METHODOLOGY: 
Assigned Brands: Maruti, Tata, Hyundai, Toyota 
Assigned Location: Mumbai
### 1) Research and Planning: 
• Understand the structure of Cars24.com. 
• Identify the HTML elements containing the required information. 
### 2) Data Extraction: 
Write a script to scrape the necessary details (kilometers driven, year of manufacture, fuel type, transmission, and price) for the assigned 
brand. 
 • Initialize Selenium WebDriver: Selenium WebDriver is set up and configured to use the Chrome browser. This allows for automated interaction with the website.
• Extract Car Details: The script finds and extracts car names, details, and prices from the HTML elements. 
For each car, it extracts the car name and manufacturing year, kilometers driven, fuel type, and transmission type from the details list and price from the price tag.
### 3) Data Cleaning:
Ensure the scraped data is clean and organized for analysis.
### 4) Saving Data into file: 
The structured data is converted into a pandas DataFrame and saved to a CSV file. 
### 5) Data Presentation: 
Present the collected data in a structured format in a CSV. 
### 7)Analyzing Gathered Data:
Used Microsoft Power BI to create Interactive Dashboards.
